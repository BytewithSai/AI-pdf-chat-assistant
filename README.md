## 🧠 How It Works

1. Upload a PDF.
2. The PDF is loaded using PyPDFLoader.
3. The document is split into chunks.
4. HuggingFace Embeddings generate vector representations.
5. FAISS stores and retrieves relevant chunks.
6. LangChain builds the retrieval pipeline.
7. Groq Llama 3.3 generates answers based only on the retrieved context.
8. Responses are displayed in a ChatGPT-like interface.
